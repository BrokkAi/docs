# Welcome to Brokk

Sidle up to the hearth and grab a horn of mead and listen to the tale of Brokk, the code assistant forged in the fires of Niðavellir to aid developers in their quest for coding mastery.

### “Skål !”

**Brokk** (the [Norse god of the forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokkr?ref=blog.brokk.ai)) is the first code assistant that understands code semantically, not just as chunks of text. Brokk is designed to allow LLMs to work effectively on large codebases that cannot be jammed entirely into working context.

To accomplish this, the Brokk team has broken free of the past forty years of IDE design to rethink how a human engineer can most effectively supervise an AI assistant. With Brokk, your job is not to read and write code a line at a time but to supply the LLM with the appropriate knowledge of the codebase so that it can handle the tactical details of code production.
