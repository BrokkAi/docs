# Sign up for Brokk and Get Started in Minutes

To get started with Brokk, simply follow these steps: we highly recommend starting with the desktop application, but you can also use the VS Code extension or the CLI if you prefer. The ideal choice depends on your workflow and preferences, but it is beneficial for the most powerful tooling to install Desktop and add in one or both the VScode or ClI tool. All three options provide access to the similar powerful core features.
